Although demonstrating promising performance in many applications, we observe that most of existing methods directly combine multiple views to learn an optimal similarity for clustering. These methods would cause intensive computational complexity and over-complicated optimization. In this paper, we theoretically uncover the connection between existing k-means clustering and the alignment between"}, "filled": false, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0524.pdf", "author_id": ["5o9hK3EAAAAJ", "A56vWC4AAAAJ", "", "quDLqhwAAAAJ", "frKTkdoAAAAJ", "", "Pdt-EUAAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:NSaXqWwLNK4J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMulti-view%2BClustering%2Bvia%2BLate%2BFusion%2BAlignment%2BMaximization%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,33&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=NSaXqWwLNK4J&ei=N_ghaOi_DJDIieoPn6y1iAQ&json=", "num_citations": 265, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12552670622718043701&as_sdt=5,33&sciodt=0,33&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:NSaXqWwLNK4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Multi-view+Clustering+via+Late+Fusion+Alignment+Maximization&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33", "eprint_url": "https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0524.pdf"}
