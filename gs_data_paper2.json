Although widely applied in large-scale applications, existing approaches do not pay sufficient attention to establishing correct correspondences between the anchor sets across views. To be specific, anchor graphs obtained from different views are not aligned column-wisely. Such an Anchor-Unaligned Problem (AUP) would cause inaccurate graph fusion and degrade the clustering"}, "filled": false, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/270339c997293ca2988c62f4308e389f-Abstract-Conference.html", "author_id": ["5o9hK3EAAAAJ", "A56vWC4AAAAJ", "7LvMGmAAAAAJ", "", "MmH2POsAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:iAFLeAb_fmAJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAlign%2Bthen%2BFusion:%2BGeneralized%2BLarge-scale%2BMulti-view%2BClustering%2Bwith%2BAnchor%2BMatching%2BCorrespondences%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,33&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=iAFLeAb_fmAJ&ei=M_ghaMioN7yJieoPlKXb4AY&json=", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=6953275277959692680&as_sdt=5,33&sciodt=0,33&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:iAFLeAb_fmAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Align+then+Fusion:+Generalized+Large-scale+Multi-view+Clustering+with+Anchor+Matching+Correspondences&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33", "eprint_url": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/270339c997293ca2988c62f4308e389f-Paper-Conference.pdf"}
